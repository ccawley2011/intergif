        EXAMPLE GIF WRITING CODE
        ========================

    This is a simple example program which creates a GIF file
using the InterGif 6 source code as a library.
    As well as the InterGif source code, you will need a copy of
DeskLib in order to compile this example. If you're not using
DeskLib, but are using RiscOSLib (bleurrgh) or OSLib instead,
you'll need to go and fiddle with Source.c.routils in the
InterGif source distribution.
    Check out the Makefile: you'll need to tell the C compiler
where to find "animlib.h" and the linker where to find the "Lib"
file from the InterGif source distribution.
    I used Acorn CC5.06 to test this code, but it should work on
anything else too.
    This code may be freely distributed, modified, given away,
sold, anthologised etc., just like the InterGif code itself. If
you do anything interesting with it, let me know!

    For example GIF *reading* code, see the ViewerSrc directory.
